/// duplicating logic.

/// Both call-sites care about the same three things in the same order:
///   1. capture a snapshot if the policy is on and we can resolve a
///      bundle ID,
///   2. run the upgrade,
///   3. record an `UpgradeHistoryEntry` regardless of the snapshot
///      outcome, so the audit trail stays complete even when the
///      snapshot was skipped or failed.
///
/// Failure to capture a snapshot **never** blocks the upgrade — that is
/// the whole reason this helper splits step (1) from step (2): the
/// upgrade is the user-visible action, the snapshot is a safety net.
